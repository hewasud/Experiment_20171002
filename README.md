Experiment difference between EF6 and EF Core when using an extension method to handle left joins.

LeftJoin extension method to combine GroupJoin and SelectMany methods was implemented and was functioning with data context setup using EF6.

Investigate why this method is failing when the datacontext was setup with EF Core 2.0.
